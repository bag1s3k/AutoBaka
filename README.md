# AutoBaka App

**AutoBaka** is a simple script that calculates your average grades from Bakaláři.

## How it started
Our school blocked access to our grade averages, so I came with an idea. After doing some research, I found two options: Selenium or BeautifulSoup. Thanks the responsive layout of the Baka page, I chose Selenium.

## Getting started

To try the app, download the repository from <https://github.com/bag1s3k/AutoBaka>

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bag1s3k/AutoBaka.git
```

## Requirements

These are the versions that I currently use.
You can try others, but compatibility is not guaranteed. **(I'm regularly updating my system, so the older ones can work)**

![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Windows_11-24H2-lightblue)
![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Chrome-Updated-yellow)

> ⚠️ **Chrome Required**: This app uses Chromedriver via WebDriverManager. Make sure you have Google Chrome installed and keep it up to date, because the driver is matched automatically to your installed Chrome version.

## Usage

Every file in repo which is template e.g. `.env.template` rename it by removing `.template`

Set your login details to `config\.env`

  ```dotenv
  BAKA_USERNAME=username
  BAKA_PASSWORD=password
  ```

Setup config to `config\config.ini`

```ini
[PATHS]
result_path = c:\example\result.txt 
```
>💡 **idea**: You can export the result file to your cloud, so you can access it on your phone as well.

```ini
[URLS]
login_url = https://baka.website/login # login page
marks_url = https://baka.website/next/prubzna.aspx?s=chrono
timetable_url = https://bakaweb.school.cz/next/rozvrh.aspx
absence_url = https://bakaweb.school.cz/Absence/Continuous
```

To get url, login to your bakaláři website interface then go:

`marks_url` Grade > Interim Grading > Chronological button`

<p><img src="docs/screenshot_chronological.png" alt="Chronological button" style="width:100%;"/></p>

`timetable_url` Schooling > ...

`absence_url` ...

```ini
[SETTINGS]
timeout = 15 # default and required but you can try different
headless_mode = True # Wanna see what is happening
quit_driver = True # close the window after the program end
```

**Using virtual environment `.venv`**

Download all required libraries from `requirements.txt` ⚠️*while you are installing requirements you have to be in project root*

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Activate virtual enviroment `.venv`

```bash
cd C:\example\autobaka 
```

```bash
.\.venv\Scripts\activate.ps1
```

You should see `(.venv)` before your path: `(.venv) C:\example\autobaka>`

Run script `main.py` using login details from `.env`

```bash
python main.py
```

***Possible options:***  
- `"--login", "-l"` by using this one you have to enter your login details **username password**

```bash
python main.py --login username password # --login or -l to use login details as options
```

## Examples

**Login details from `.env`**

```bash
(.venv) PS C:\local\work\autobaka> python main.py
........ Successfully
(.venv) PS C:\local\work\autobaka>
```

**Login details from cmd**

```bash
(.venv) PS C:\local\work\autobaka> python main.py -l username password
........ Successfully
(.venv) PS C:\local\work\autobaka>
```

## Known Issues

- while running script it shows `DevTools listening on ws://127.0.0.1:xxxxx/devtools/browser/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx`, and there is 1 dot before this message, I wanna delete it
- there are for sure a lot of improvements and issues in the repository, but I'm still adding new features, I'm not interested in finding bugs and improvements

## Planned

- UI
- CLI
- mobile version?
- absence planner


## FAQ

#### I run the program over and over again, and instantly I  get error: `net::ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED` or `Moving to the target page failed`
- Check your internet connection; some types of internet connections are blocked for some reason, try to change to another one
- Try to log in manually, if the page doesn't load, it's not our app; the website might be down or being updated
